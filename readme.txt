The IK Facebook Plugin is an easy-to-use plugin for adding a Custom Facebook Feed to a WordPress site, with a shortcode or widget.

== Description ==

The IK Facebook Plugin is an **easy-to-use** plugin that allows users to add a **custom Facebook Feed widget** to the sidebar, as a widget, or to embed the custom Facebook Feed widget into a Page or Post using the shortcode.  The IK Facebook Plugin also allows you to insert a Like Button widget into the Page, Post, or theme.

= The IK Facebook Plugin is a great plugin for many uses, including: =

* Adding SEO friendly content to your website
* Powering your blog with your Facebook Feed - avoid the need to maintain content in multiple locations!
* Embed a Custom Facebook Feed Widget in your Sidebar or Footer
* Styling a Custom Facebook Feed
* Adding a Facebook Like Button to your website, anywhere!
* Showing Facebook Comments in your Custom Facebook Feed!
* Adding a Facebook-powered Photo Gallery to your website!
* Show multiple different custom Facebook Feeds!
* Custom Facebook Feed Widget allows user to override Site Wide Options
* Ability to Pass Page ID Via Shortcode and Widget Allows Multiple Facebook Feeds on One Page!
* and our quality documentation won't leave you hanging!

= User Friendly Features =
The IK Facebook Plugin includes options to set the Title of the custom Facebook Feed widget, whether or not to show the Like Button above the custom Facebook Feed widget, and whether or not to show the Profile Picture.  The IK Facebook Plugin supports both the Light and Dark color schemes for the Like Button widget and has multiple color schemes for the custom Facebook Feed widget.  The IK Facebook Plugin allows you to pass the ID of the Facebook page via the shortcode - allowing you to display the feeds from multiple accounts on one page!

= Professional Development =

The IK Facebook Plugin is a free version of [IK Social Pro](http://iksocialpro.com/ "IK Social Pro") - IK Social Pro is a professionally developed WordPress plugin that integrates your Facebook Feed into your WordPress website as a custom widget.  The IK Facebook Plugin receives regular updates with new features and tweaks to the custom Facebook Feed.  With the IK Facebook Plugin, you can easily add **Search Engine Optimization friendly** content to your website without extra effort -- no iframe means the content exists on your site and is crawlable by search engines like Google!  

= Powerful Customization =

The IK Facebook Plugin includes the option to set your own custom CSS for styling purposes or, if you prefer, the IK Facebook Plugin allows you to include a custom style sheet in your theme directory  -- either method is great for displaying a custom Facebok Feed widget. The IK Facebook Plugin also allows the user to select from a few pre-made Feed Themes, to help generate their custom Facebook Feed widget.  *Gone are the days of fighting with the Facebook Social Plugin!*

= New Features Are On The Way! =

Currently on our roadmap, we are planning on doing a lot more with the new Photo Gallery features - such as lightbox technology and other javascript options, sidebar widgets, and more!  We also have plans to add more options to the sidebar custom facebook feed widget, as well as adding the ability to display videos in your custom facebook feed.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the contents of `/ik-facebook/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the IK Facebook Plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. [Click here](http://iksocialpro.com/installation-usage-instructions/configuration-options-and-instructions/ "Configuration Options and Instructions") for information on how to configure the plugin.

= Outputting the Feed =
* To output the custome Facebook Feed, place `[ik_fb_feed colorscheme="light or dark" use_thumb="true or false" width="250" num_posts="5" id="123456789"]` in the body of a post, or use the Appearance section to add the The IK Facebook Plugin Widget to your Widgets area.  If 'use_thumb' is set to true, the value of 'width' will be ignored.  If 'use_thumb' or 'width' are not set, the values from the Options page will be used.  If id is not set, the shortcode will use the Page ID from your Settings page.  All of the options on the widget will use the defaults, drawn from the Settings page, if they aren't passed via the widget.
* You can also use the function `ik_fb_display_feed($colorscheme,$use_thumb,$width)` to display the custom facebook feed in your theme.

= Outputting the Like Button = 
* To output the Like Button, place `[ik_fb_like_button url="http://some_url" height"desired_iframe_height" colorscheme="light or dark"]` in the body of a post.
* You can also use the function `ik_fb_display_like_button($url_to_like,$height_of_iframe,$colorscheme)` to output a like button in your theme.

= Outputting a Photo Gallery = 
* To output a Photo Gallery, place `[ik_fb_gallery id="539627829386059" size="130x73" title="Hello World!"]` in the body of a post.  If no size is passed, it will default to 320 x 180.  Size options are 2048x1152, 960x540, 720x405, 600x337, 480x270, 320x180, and 130x73.  The ID number is found by looking at the URL of the link to the Album on Facebook.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help!  I need a Facebook App ID / Facebook Secret Key! =

OK!  We have a great page with some helpful information [here](http://iksocialpro.com/installation-usage-instructions/how-to-get-an-app-id-and-secret-key-from-facebook/ "Configuration Options and Instructions").

Follow the information on that page to Create A Simple Facebook App - you'll be guided along the way to get your App ID, Secret Key, and any other info you may need.

= Ack!  All I see is 'IK FB: Please check your settings.' - what do I do? =

It's all good!  This just means there is no feed data - this could be due to bad settings, including a bad Page ID, App ID, or Secret Key, or it could be due to some other error such as not having cUrl installed.  Be sure to check your Facebook Page's Privacy Settings, too!  Check the plugin instructions for help (or send us a message if you think it's an error.)

= So what's up with this 'Publicly Accessible Page' thing? =

OK, so here's the deal:

Your Facebook Feed needs to come from a Publicly Accessible Facebook page.  If your page is Private, if its a Personal Profile and not a Page, or if you have an Age Limit set that thus requires the user to login, the plugin won't be able to display the feed data (it will instead just display the page title, like button, and profile pic - even that can be dependent upon your settings.)

Here's how to test if your page is Public or Private:

Logout of Facebook and then try to visit the Facebook Page in question.  If Facebook wants you to login to be able to view the Feed, then this page is not Publicly Accessible.  You just need to update the Page's relevant settings so that it is.

= I've set an image width on the options page, but it isn't working! =

No worries!  Did you include any non-integer characters?  Be sure the width is just something like "250" (ignore the quotes) - you don't need to include "px".

= Instead of a Like Button, all I see is "Error"! =

That probably means the URL you've given the Like Button is invalid.  Sometimes this happens in the feed widget, if the URL isn't a valid Facebook Page.

= Other people's posts are showing up on my wall!  How do I stop it? =

If you are using the Free version of the plugin, you'll need to [purchase IK Social Pro](http://iksocialpro.com/purchase-ik-social-pro/ "Purchase IK Social Pro") first.  Once installed, look for the option titled "Only Show Page Owner's Posts".  When that is checked, these posts will be hidden from view.

= Hey!  I need more control over the styling of my feed, but I don't know CSS! =

If you are using the Free version of the plugin, you'll need to [purchase IK Social Pro](http://iksocialpro.com/purchase-ik-social-pro/ "Purchase IK Social Pro") first.  Once installed, look for the long list of options under the heading "Display Options".  You will be able to use these to control font size and color for all of the different text elements, feed width and height for the in page and sidebar versions each, and more being added all the time!

= I see this plugin uses caching. Do I need to do anything for this? =

Nope!  Thanks to the WordPress Transient API, all you have to do is sit back and relax and we'll do the rest!

= I Want All Of My Posts Visible -- Not Contained In A Box! =

Try using the "No Style" theme -- this will output everything in a list.  You can also turn off the Like Button, Feed Title, and Profile Pic to have it look more like a list of posts.

= I Want All To Show The Number of Likes In My Facebook Feed! =

The Pro version of IK Facebook has this functionality - [purchase IK Social Pro](http://iksocialpro.com/purchase-ik-social-pro/ "Purchase IK Social Pro")

= I Want All To Show Avatars In My Facebook Feed! =

The Pro version of IK Facebook has this functionality - [purchase IK Social Pro](http://iksocialpro.com/purchase-ik-social-pro/ "Purchase IK Social Pro")

= I Want All To Show Comments In My Facebook Feed! =

The Pro version of IK Facebook has this functionality - [purchase IK Social Pro](http://iksocialpro.com/purchase-ik-social-pro/ "Purchase IK Social Pro")

= Urk!  How to find my Album's ID for outputting a photo gallery? =

OK, try this: looking at the following url, you want to grab the number that appears directly after "set=a." and before the next period - 
facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.**539627829386059**.148135.322657451083099&type=3

In this case, the ID is '539627829386059'.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the Configuration Options Settings page.
2. This is the Style Options Settings page.  These settings help you control the visible appearance of your custom facebook feed.
3. This is the Display Options Settings page.  These settings help you control what content appears in your custom facebook feed.
4. This is the Facebook Feed Widget.  The options on this widget allow you to override the settings you have selected on your Settings panel.
