The IK Facebook Plugin is a simple plugin for adding bits of Facebook to a WordPress site.

== Description ==

The IK Facebook Plugin is an easy-to-use plugin that allows users to add a Facebook Feed to the sidebar, as a widget, or to embed the Feed into a Page or Post using the shortcode.  The IK Facebook Plugin also allows you to insert a Like Button into the Page, Post, or theme

The IK Facebook Plugin includes options to set the Title of the Widget, whether or not to show the Like Button above the Feed, and whether or not to show the Profile Picture.  The IK Facebook Plugin supports both the Light and Dark color schemes for the Like Button.

The IK Facebook Plugin includes the option to set your own custom CSS for styling purposes or, if you prefer, the IK Facebook Plugin allows you to include a custom style sheet in your theme directory. The IK Facebook Plugin also allows the user to select from a few pre-made Feed Themes.  Gone are the days of fighting with the Facebook Social Plugin!

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the contents of `/ik-facebook/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the IK Facebook Plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit this address for information on how to configure the plugin: https://illuminatikarate.com/ik-facebook-plugin/

= Outputting the Feed =
* To output the Feed, place `[ik_fb_feed colorscheme="light or dark" use_thumb="true or false" width="250"]` in the body of a post, or use the Appearance section to add the The IK Facebook Plugin Widget to your Widgets area.  If 'use_thumb' is set to true, the value of 'width' will be ignored.  If 'use_thumb' or 'width' are not set, the values from the Options page will be used.
* You can also use the function `ik_fb_display_feed($colorscheme,$use_thumb,$width)` to display the feed in your theme.

= Outputting the Like Button = 
* To output the Like Button, place `[ik_fb_like_button url="http://some_url" height"desired_iframe_height" colorscheme="light or dark"]` in the body of a post.
* You can also use the function `ik_fb_display_like_button($url_to_like,$height_of_iframe,$colorscheme)` to output a like button in your theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help!  I need an App ID/Secret Key! =

OK!  We have a great blog post with some helpful information here: https://illuminatikarate.com/blog/how-to-create-a-simple-facebook-app/

Follow the information on that page to Create A Simple Facebook App - you'll be guided along the way to get your App ID, Secret Key, and any other info you may need.

= Ack!  All I see is 'IK FB: Please check your settings.' - what do I do? =

It's all good!  This just means there is no feed data - this could be due to bad settings, including a bad Page ID, App ID, or Secret Key, or it could be due to some other error such as not having cUrl installed.  Be sure to check your Facebook Page's Privacy Settings, too!  Check the plugin instructions for help (or send us a message if you think it's an error.)

= I've set an image width on the options page, but it isn't working! =

No worries!  Did you include any non-integer characters?  Be sure the width is just something like "250" (ignore the quotes) - you don't need to include "px".

= Instead of a Like Button, all I see is "Error"! =

That probably means the URL you've given the Like Button is invalid.  Sometimes this happens in the feed widget, if the URL isn't a valid Facebook Page.

= Other people's posts are showing up on my wall!  How do I stop it? =

= Hey!  I need more control over the styling of my feed, but I don't know CSS! =

= I see this plugin uses caching. Do I need to do anything for this? =

Nope!  Thanks to the WordPress Transient API, all you have to do is sit back and relax and we'll do the rest!
